# MotivationalBinary (A.K.A. HEXadecimalChuck)

## HEXadecimalChuck

This was supposed to be Motivational quotes in binary but due to the lack of free APIs that had the required needs of this project, and twitter's mas tweet length of 280 I just decided to use random quotes of Chuck Norris to hexadecimal

## How to use:

You will need twitter's api keys you can insert them in the file api_key.py
between the quotation marks "".

When you run tweeterBot.py it fetches a random chuck quote converts it into hexadecimal and posts it on twitter (You can setup a cron job to automate it or use the schedule module for python)

## Requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt:

  * requests
  * TwitterAPI
